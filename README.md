# U.S. Public Debt Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of U.S. public debt using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to process raw historical data, identify key trends, and create a summary dashboard to answer critical questions about the nation's debt patterns. The final output is an intuitive dashboard that visualizes yearly changes, monthly seasonality, and long-term projections.

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis within Excel, including data cleaning, calculation of metrics, data visualization, and summarization of key insights.

## Key Questions Addressed

The analysis was structured to answer three main questions:

1.  **Yearly Trend:** What was the yearly debt percentage increase for each year compared to the previous year?
2.  **Monthly Seasonality:** Which months have historically seen the highest and lowest increases in total debt?
3.  **Future Projections:** What is the projected growth of publicly held debt in the next few years?

## Dashboard Summary & Key Insights

The final dashboard presents the following key findings:

#### 1. Yearly Debt Percentage Increase (2016-2022)
*   A significant spike in debt increase occurred in **2020**, largely driven by the economic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.
*   In the preceding years (2016-2019), the average increase for Total Public Debt Outstanding was approximately **15%**.
*   The analysis tracks three distinct debt components: Debt Held by the Public, Intragovernmental Holdings, and Total Public Debt.

#### 2. Monthly Average Debt Patterns
*   **Highest Debt Months:** Debt levels historically increase the most during **January, February, November, and December**.
*   **Lowest Debt Months:** The lowest increases typically occur during **April, May, June, and July**.
*   **Hypothesis:** This seasonal pattern may be linked to consumer and government spending around major U.S. holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's, leading to higher debt. The lower-debt months lack similar large-scale spending events.

#### 3. Projected Publicly Held Debt
*   Publicly held debt has shown consistent and accelerating growth over the past decades, increasing from approximately **$6 trillion in 2008 to $17 trillion in 2019**.
*   The debt is projected to continue increasing at a steady pace, reaching new highs in the coming years.
*   This long-term trend suggests a need for further research into related economic indicators like the Stock Market, Housing Market, and Credit Card Purchases.

## Methodology & Tools

*   **Tool:** Microsoft Excel
*   **Process:** The analysis followed a structured workflow:
    1.  **Data Collection:** Started with raw, unstructured data.
    2.  **Data Cleaning:** Processed the data to ensure consistency and usability.
    3.  **Analysis & Calculation:** Used Excel formulas and functions to calculate yearly percentage changes and monthly averages.
    4.  **Visualization:** Created line charts, bar charts, and area charts to visualize the findings.
    5.  **Dashboarding:** Assembled all visualizations and summaries into a single, comprehensive "Final Outputs" sheet.

## Excel Workbook Structure

The Excel file is organized into several sheets to maintain a clean and logical workflow:

*   `Scenario`: Outlines the project goals and questions.
*   `Raw Data`: Contains the original, untouched dataset.
*   `Cleaned Data`: The dataset after cleaning and formatting.
*   `Yearly % Change`: Calculations and source data for the yearly trend chart.
*   `Monthly Historicals`: Calculations and source data for the monthly average chart.
*   `Projected Growth`: Source data for the debt projection chart.
*   `Final Outputs`: The main dashboard presenting all visualizations and conclusions.
